"""macOS Keychain access via the ``security`` CLI.

A small wrapper around the system ``security`` tool for storing generic
passwords, used instead of the third-party ``keyring`` library. Two reasons:

- The macOS hot path no longer needs the ``keyring`` dependency.
- Keychain items are created and read by the same stable ``security`` binary, so
  reads stay silent across upgrades. ``keyring`` (and any in-process
  Security.framework call) anchors the item's access to the *Python interpreter*,
  which ``uv tool upgrade`` rebuilds — at which point macOS can show the "wants to
  use your keychain" prompt. ``security`` never changes, so creator == reader and
  there is no prompt.

The read/write/delete shapes mirror Claude Code's own implementation
(``utils/secureStorage/macOsKeychainStorage.ts``):

- ``set_password`` hex-encodes the value (``-X``) and pipes the command through
  ``security -i`` (stdin) so the secret never appears in process argv (a
  process-monitor / CrowdStrike concern). It falls back to argv only when the
  command would overflow ``security -i``'s 4096-byte stdin line buffer, which
  would otherwise truncate mid-argument and silently corrupt the entry.
- ``get_password`` uses ``find-generic-password ... -w`` and treats exit code 44
  as "not found" (returns ``None``); any *other* non-zero exit raises so callers
  can tell a genuine miss apart from a locked/denied/unavailable Keychain.

Caveat: values must be printable text. ``find-generic-password -w`` prints the
stored data raw only when it is printable; data with non-printable bytes comes
back *hex-encoded*, so a write/read round-trip would not be identity. Fine for
this codebase (credentials are ASCII JSON), but don't reuse this wrapper for
arbitrary binary data. Claude Code's ``-w`` reads share the same constraint.

This module is import-safe on every platform (it only shells out at call time);
its functions are only meaningful on macOS.
